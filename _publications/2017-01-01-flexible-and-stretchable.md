excerpt: 'Understanding the mechanisms of the loss and recovery of neuron function following spinal cord injury requires precise stimulation and recording of neural activity. We developed flexible and stretchable polymer probes coated with conductive silver nanowire mesh which demonstrates excellent optical, electronic, and mechanical properties for implantation in spinal cord tissue. We demonstrated simultaneous optogenetic stimulation and recording of specific neurons in mice, while maintaining function and minimizing damage under normal spinal cord motion.'
