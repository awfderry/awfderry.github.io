Hello! I am a PhD student in [Biomedical Informatics](https://dbds.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, advised by [Dr. Russ Altman](https://helix.stanford.edu). My research focuses on the development of new machine learning methods for 3D protein structure and function analysis, with particular interest in applications in functional site identification and drug discovery. Before my PhD, I obtained a BS in Materials Science and Engineering at MIT, where I did research in bioelectronics and molecular dynamics. Outside the lab, you can find me cycling, skiing, or exploring the wilderness.
