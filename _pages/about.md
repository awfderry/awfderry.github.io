Hello! I am a graduate student in [Biomedical Informatics](https://med.stanford.edu/bmi.html) at Stanford University, advised by [Dr. Russ Altman](https://helix.stanford.edu/index.html). My research focuses on the development of new machine learning methods for 3D protein structure analysis, with particular interest in applications in pharmacogenetics and drug discovery. This website contains links to my publications, talks, CV, and other relevant information.
