Hello! I am a graduate student in [Biomedical Informatics](https://med.stanford.edu/bmi.html) at Stanford University, advised by [Dr. Russ Altman](https://helix.stanford.edu/index.html). My research focuses on the development of new machine learning methods for 3D protein structure analysis, with particular interest in applications in pharmacogenetics and drug discovery. Before my PhD, I obtained a BS in Materials Science and Engineering at MIT, where I did research in bioelectronics and molecular dynamics.
